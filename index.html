                                must be prepared for your pet's food,

                                importantly, you should be ready to commit to
                                owning a cat, and happy about the new addition
                                to your life.

                                your pet for their first examination once she

                                Energetic kittens can be demanding, needing lots
                                of playtime, which may be challenging for people
                                with active lifestyles or busy work schedules
                                that keep them away from home for long periods.
                                On the other hand, adult cats are often calmer
                                and better able to entertain themselves.
