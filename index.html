                                your pet for their first examination once she

                                Energetic kittens can be demanding, needing lots
                                of playtime, which may be challenging for people
                                with active lifestyles or busy work schedules
                                that keep them away from home for long periods.
                                On the other hand, adult cats are often calmer
                                and better able to entertain themselves.

                            Hey! I am Aisyah, you can also call me Ai.
                            I am making this to support the "Adopt, Don't Shop"
                            campaign. I also hope that human can always consider
                            every aspect possible before adopting or buying a
                            pet. They are not something that you can get rid of
                            when you get tired or bored of them. A pet is a
                            lifetime commitment. You must take care of them and
                            love them like they love you!
